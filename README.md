# onekit

onekit is a from-scratch schema language and toolchain for building HTTP APIs — no protobuf, no buf, no protoc.

Define your API once in `.onk` files, and generate the boring pieces around it: Go HTTP servers, Go clients, TypeScript clients, TypeScript server routes, Python clients, and OpenAPI 3.1 documents. Every generator is built from scratch against a native intermediate representation (`internal/onkir`) — there is no `google.golang.org/protobuf` dependency anywhere in this repository.

## The `.onk` language

```
package example.users

message User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

message CreateUserRequest {
  name: string @len(2, 100)
  email: string @email
}

service UserService {
  base_path: "/v1"
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": string @required @format("uuid")
  }

  createUser(CreateUserRequest) -> User @post("/users")
}
```

No explicit field numbers, no wire-format baggage, no separate options-extension mechanism — attributes are just `@decorator(args)` on the field or method they apply to. The language is still v0.2 and evolving; read [`examples/onk-simple-api`](examples/onk-simple-api) for a complete, working example, or `internal/onklang` for the grammar itself.

Two things `.onk` does that protobuf couldn't:

- **RPC error unions** — `-> User | NotFoundError | ValidationError` makes a method's possible errors part of the schema, so generated clients can produce exhaustive, statically-typed error handling instead of "parse the body as any `*Error`."
- **Doc comments** (`///`) that flow straight into generated Go doc comments, TS/Python docstrings, and OpenAPI descriptions.

## What it generates

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/gengo` | Go structs, validation, HTTP server (`net/http` `ServeMux`), and HTTP client |
| `internal/gents` | TypeScript types, a `fetch`-based client, and framework-agnostic server routes (Web Fetch API) |
| `internal/genpy` | Python `@dataclass` models, `IntEnum` enums, and a stdlib (`urllib`) client |
| `internal/genopenapi` | OpenAPI 3.1 documents (via `pb33f/libopenapi`) |

All four target languages/formats are driven off the same compiled schema (`internal/onkir`), produced by parsing `.onk` (`internal/onklang`) and resolving cross-references (`internal/onkcompile`).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1homsi/onekit.git
cd onekit
make build          # builds ./bin/onek
```

Try the example:

```bash
cd examples/onk-simple-api
go test ./...        # exercises the already-generated code end to end
../../bin/onek build .   # regenerates api/*.gen.go and docs/openapi.yaml from models.onk + service.onk
```

## The `onek` CLI

A project is a directory with an `onekit.toml` and one or more `.onk` files:

```toml
module = "github.com/you/yourapp/api"
route_prefix = "/api"

[generate.go-server]
out = "./api"

[generate.go-client]
out = "./api"

[generate.ts-client]
out = "./web/client"

[generate.openapi]
out = "./docs"
title = "Your API"
version = "1.0.0"
```

`route_prefix` is optional. It prepends a public HTTP prefix to every generated
server, client, and OpenAPI route without changing generated package or import
paths. For example, schemas under `hub/business/v1` still generate into
`hub/business/v1`, while their routes start with `/api/hub/business/v1`.

The prefix must be a canonical literal URL path such as `/api` or
`/api/internal`: it must start with `/`, must not end with `/`, and cannot
contain query strings, fragments, percent escapes, or path parameters.

```bash
onek check   # parse + compile every .onk file, no codegen - fast validation
onek build   # parse + compile + generate everything configured in onekit.toml
```

`onek fmt` is not implemented yet.

Install the CLI:

```bash
go install github.com/1homsi/onekit/cmd/onek@latest
```

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/onek/` | CLI entrypoint |
| `internal/onklang/` | Lexer, parser, AST for `.onk` |
| `internal/onkcompile/` | Compiles parsed `.onk` files into the IR, resolving cross-file type references |
| `internal/onkir/` | The native intermediate representation every generator consumes |
| `internal/onek/` | `onekit.toml` parsing and the `build`/`check` orchestration |
| `internal/gengo/`, `internal/gents/`, `internal/genpy/`, `internal/genopenapi/` | The four generator backends |
| `examples/onk-simple-api/` | A complete, working example with committed generated output |

## Status

This is a young project mid-migration from an earlier protobuf-based design. Ported and tested: messages (scalars, repeated, optional, maps, nested types), enums, oneofs (discriminated unions, fully typed in Go/TS), field validation (`@email`, `@uuid`, `@len`, `@range`, `@in`, `@required`), HTTP path/query param binding, required-header checks, RPC error unions with per-error-type HTTP status codes, and all four generator backends.

Not yet ported from the old protobuf-based generators: SSE streaming, and the `flatten`/`unwrap`/`int64_encoding`/`enum_encoding`/`timestamp_format`/`bytes_encoding` JSON-mapping annotations. Contributions welcome.
